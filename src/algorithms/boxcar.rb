  # @brief    In order to extract meaningful information easily we utilize a box car or FIR filter known from DSP theory.
  #
  # @param    input   Array containing beat [ [ time, energy value ], ...]
  # @param    order   N is the filter order; an Nth-order filter has (N + 1) terms on the right-hand
  #                   side. The x[n âˆ’ i] in these terms are commonly referred to as taps, based on the structure of a
  #                   tapped delay line that in many implementations or block diagrams provides the delayed inputs to
  #                   the multiplication operations. One may speak of a "5th order/6-tap filter", for instance.
